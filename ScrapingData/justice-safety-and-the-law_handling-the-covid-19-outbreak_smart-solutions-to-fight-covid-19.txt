Smart solutions to fight COVID-19
The UAE Government put to use several smart solutions to detect the cases of COVID-19 and control its spread. Most useful among the smart solutions is the ALHOSN UAE app. The app detects if an individual has been in close proximity to someone who had contact with someone infected with COVID-19. The other is the chatbot service titled Virtual Doctor for COVID-19. The chatbot in the Virtual Doctor service asks several vital questions which will help it to deduce if a person is at risk of getting COVID-19.

Virtual Doctor for COVID-19
Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHaP) launched a chatbot service titled Virtual Doctor for COVID-19. People can use the service to assess whether their symptoms could be associated with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.
The chatbot in the Virtual Doctor service asks questions relating to the persons’ travel history, if they have come in contact with someone who has travelled and is sick and if they have come in contact with someone known to have COVID-19. It also asks if the person is suffering from specific symptoms and about his health habits. Depending on the person’s answers, the chatbot will deduce if he/she is at risk. It will connect him/her to a doctor through the same service.

TraceCovid app
The TraceCovid app detects other devices that have the same app and shares proximity data with it. When two users who have installed the TraceCovid app come in contact with one another, a ‘Secure Tracing Identifier’ (STI) is exchanged and stored in their respective phones. This STI list contains the records of individuals that a user had close contact with. If one of the users is infected with the virus, the relevant authorities will be able to access the user’s data and timestamp and reach out to possibly infected individuals easily.

Hence, the app helps in tracking COVID-19 cases by auto-recording all the people who had been near a COVID-19 patient, including those that might not be known to the patient. The app functions on Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. The Bluetooth feature must remain active at all times for the application to read and determine the user’s exact location.
