DFSA crowdfunding regulations intend to accelerate growth in the financial technology (FinTech) industry in the UAE and the region by targeting the specific requirements of crowdfunding platforms. The regulations ensure clear governance for FinTech businesses and provide appropriate protection for their customers. They also formalise DFSA’s approach to regulating crowdfunding platforms which had operated through interim arrangements since 2016.
