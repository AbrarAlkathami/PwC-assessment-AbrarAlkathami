Plans for setting up IPV6
The UAE is heading towards applying the concept of smart cities and the increasing emerging technologies such as big data, the Internet, cloud services and others.
Accordingly, the UAE digital government is setting plans and future strategies to adopt the internet protocol 6.0 (IPV6). This version is expected to make a big change in the digital world with its high security and capacity features that will meet the increasing growth of the internet usage and IP addresses.

As the IPV6 is seen as a major solution for the challenges resulting from Internet Protocol 4.0, this new protocol will keep the UAE ahead of the latest technologies in the race towards digital transformation and uninterrupted provision of services.
TDRA’s effort to implement IPV6
Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority-TDRA organizes extensive workshops in collaboration with government and private entities, at the local and international level, to discuss special technicalities of working with IPV6, the current situation and the basic requirements for building a comprehensive system.

In addition, TDRA is collaborating with both Etisalat and du, the internet service providers in the UAE, and with the local eGovernments to develop the telecommunications sector and spread the usage of IPV6 on their networks in the country, which have a prominent impact on the economic and social growth.

TDRA, represented by the .ae Domain Administration Department established the UAE top-level domain infrastructure to comply with the IPv6. The .ae and the Arabic top-level domain (.Emarat) registry system are currently capable of assigning IPv6 Domain Name System delegation to their customers who wish to serve their websites through the IPv6 cloud.
