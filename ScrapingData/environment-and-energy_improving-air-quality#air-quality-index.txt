Improving air quality
The UAE established Air Quality Index (AQI), an artificial intelligence-based platform that monitors and analyses air quality. The National Air Quality Platform uses the (AQI) platform and displays information on air pollution. You can check the air quality in each area, learn about the health risks associated with each level of air quality and decide if a certain area is suitable to visit depending on the quality of air.

Air pollution
Keeping the ambient air quality within required standards has been one of the main challenges to the environment authorities in the country. Pollution is largely affected by human activities, the emissions from fuel combustion for energy, water and transport and industrial activities.

Air Quality Index (AQI)
Air Quality Index (AQI) is an Artificial Intelligence-based platform that displays accurate real-time air quality readings based on satellite data. AQI monitors and analyses air quality and produces calculated forecasts to drive data-informed decision-making and strategies that reduce air pollution.

AQI forecasts the air quality status for up to three days in advance and predicts the concentration of dust and particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns. AQI calculations are based on the measurements of five main pollutants:
AQI forecasts the air quality status for up to three days in advance and predicts the concentration of dust and particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns. AQI calculations are based on the measurements of five main pollutants:
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
Carbon monoxide (CO)
Ground ozone (O3)
Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
particulate matter with of diameter less than 10 micron (PM10).
National Air Quality Platform
The National Air Quality Platform uses the Air Quality Index (AQI) platform to provide real-time data on the quality of the air in the UAE. It displays information received from 31 air pollution monitoring stations across the UAE. You can check the air quality in each area, learn about the health risks associated with each level of air quality and decide if a certain area is suitable to visit depending on the quality of air.

National Center of Meteorology shares the information on air quality with the authorities to help them develop policies on air pollution control. This information enables researchers and academicians to study the impact of environmental factors, industrial progress and population density on air quality.
