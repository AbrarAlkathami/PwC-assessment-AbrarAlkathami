The World Bank document brings out the key benefits of open data which are:
Open data can promote economic growth by helping launch new businesses, create new jobs, increase efficiency in existing organisations and generally improve the climate for foreign investment.

Open data can help strengthen healthcare systems by connecting patients to providers, promote education and ongoing learning, and relieve hunger and improve food security on both a large and small scale.

Open data can expose and prevent mismanagement and corruption. It also helps ensure environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and build resilience to climate change.

Open data can help improve cities and urban infrastructure. It is key to high-tech smart cities, modern urban planning and the transformation of urban transportation. It can also improve resilience to disasters and ensure that critical resources will be deployed well in emergencies.
