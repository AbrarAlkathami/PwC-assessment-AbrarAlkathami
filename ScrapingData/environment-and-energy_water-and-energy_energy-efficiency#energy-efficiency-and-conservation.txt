Need for energy efficiency
There are many reasons behind the increasing interest in achieving energy efficiency and rationalisation. Some of them are:
Some of the factors that lead to the prevention of energy efficiency among consumers are:
The above equation requires careful revision of the consumption tariff from time to time, or to apply the slab tariff system. The slab tariff encourages consumers to stay within the scope of the least costly slab rather than increasing consumption to avoid the more expensive slabs.
In order to promote efficient consumption of electricity and water, an additional fuel fee is added to consumers' monthly electricity and water bill. This fee depends on the rate of increase or decrease of the actual fuel cost supplied to DEWA's generation plants.
Efficiency standards and specifications require an increase in capital expenditure to cover the sums required to purchase applications or introduce improvements that help to reduce consumption.

In July 2014,  Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure  established a new department for energy conservation and energy efficiency. One of the goals of this department is to establish a database of energy consumption by different sectors across the UAE, which allows comparisons between performance of establishments within a sector.
Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure
The UAE  promotes the use of efficient electrical equipment. It launched an efficiency-labelling scheme for window and split-unit air-conditioning systems, eliminating highly inefficient units from the market. Since July 2014, the UAE has also banned the import of inefficient incandescent light bulbs. The scheme is expected to cut energy use by 500MW per year.

In Ras Al Khaimah, Barjeel, the Green Building Regulations of the emirate issued by Ras Al Khaimah Municipality sets minimum sustainability standards for new buildings. Buildings permitted under Barjeel are expected to consume 30% less energy and water as compared to a typical building in Ras Al Khaimah. Barjeel is now mandatory for all new buildings starting from January 2020 following a one-year voluntary period.

In 2010, the UAE Cabinet approved the Green Building and Sustainable Building standards to be applied across the country. Application of these standards started at government buildings early 2011. The project is expected to save AED 10 billion by 2030 and reduce around 30 per cent of carbon emissions.

Estidama, which is the Arabic word for sustainability, is an initiative developed and promoted by Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (UPC). Through Estidama, Abu Dhabi is progressing the principles and imperatives for sustainable development, while recognising the unique cultural, climatic and economic development needs of the region.
Estidama introduced the  Pearl Building Rating System  (PBRS) in 2010 to rate energy efficiency in buildings. The PBRS encourages:
It aims to improve supply chains for sustainable and recycled materials and products.

Abu Dhabi hosts  International Renewable Energy Agency  (IRENA) since 2009, which is the first inter-governmental organisation to have its headquarters in the Middle East.
International Renewable Energy Agency
IRENA is an inter-governmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future and serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resource and financial knowledge on renewable energy.
IRENA promotes the widespread adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy, including bio-energy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, solar and wind energy, in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy access, energy security and low-carbon economic growth and prosperity. Abu Dhabi Government has set a target that by 2020 at least 7 per cent of power generation should be from renewable energy.
