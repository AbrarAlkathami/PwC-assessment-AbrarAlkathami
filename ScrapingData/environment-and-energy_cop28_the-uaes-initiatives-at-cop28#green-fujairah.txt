Green Capabilities Global Alliance for Government
The Green Capabilities Global Alliance for Government is a platform to support government efforts in upskilling employees to drive environmental sustainability and climate change resilience. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the UAE government - represented by Government Development and the Future Office and Apolitical, an online education platform. It aims to highlight the critical role of government employees in shaping and implementing climate policies, as data from Apolitical showed that 8 of every 10 government employees worldwide do not have the necessary tools or training to address climate change.
