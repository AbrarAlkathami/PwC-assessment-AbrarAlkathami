Regulating fishing practices
The UAE aims to end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible. This is one of the ways to achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.

These legislations specify areas where fishing is prohibited, species not allowed for fishing and the seasons of fishing suspension. Some of these legislations are in Arabic for reference. All files are in PDF.
