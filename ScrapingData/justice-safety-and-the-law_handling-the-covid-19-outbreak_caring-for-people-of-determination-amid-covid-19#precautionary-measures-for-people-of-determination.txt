The 'Rest assured' initiative
The ‘Rest assured’ initiative is aimed to support people of determination, their parents and their staff by educating the community members about the comprehensive response to their demands for safety and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘Rest assured’ initiative consists of five core programmes with multiple objectives and methods to respond to the demands of the people of determination.

The core programme one provides a home psychological aid kit to support people of determination during a crisis. It helps parents and family members detect if children are getting affected by the crisis and identify children who need therapeutic intervention either by parents or specialists.

The core programme two includes a series of social stories that contain simple visual answers to many questions that address children's imaginations, which, if not clarified on time, may lead to distorted and inaccurate concepts of the pandemic.

The core programme three involves a training programme for staff who are working with the people of determination to detect their behaviour and direct their parents to get right advice. It also aims to raise the level of psychological resilience of parents.

Additionally, the ministry has prepared a home-schooling guide for students with intellectual disabilities and autism.

The core programme five involves disseminating awareness-related information such as methods of sterilising things according to each individual’s disability. Information is available in sign language for those who face hearing issues, through instant text translation and voice description for those with visual impairment and through social stories for those with intellectual disabilities and autism.
