Participatory budget
The UAE government prepares its budget in a participatory method through several steps to make sure that financial resources are spent to meet the society's needs. Before drafting the budget, the government studies the ideas and trends in society. During the budgeting process, Federal National Council receives the draft budget for discussing it amongst their members and for providing feedback to Supreme Council for approval.

Introducing the general budget
The general budget is the financial programme of the federal government used to achieve economic and social development. This is accomplished through the optimal distribution and efficient use of resources within the framework of the federal strategy on the expected spending by federal authorities during the coming fiscal year, provided that income and expenditure are balanced.
general budget is the financial programme of the federal governmen

According to the Federal Decretal Law No. 26 of 2019 on Public Finance, a separate budget for federal service authorities may be earmarked and submitted to Ministry of Finance (MoF) for approval. Also, all federal authorities may, by virtue of a Cabinet resolution, be assigned to prepare a draft medium-term budget. The Cabinet resolution shall determine the budget’s terms in years provided that it includes annual estimates for both income and expenditure, as approved by the Cabinet.

Issuing the budget law
Every year during the third month of the fiscal year, Minister of Finance issues a circular containing steps for the preparation of the draft budget for the following year. The circular includes budget cap, approved strategic objectives, indicators, revenue forecast and a fixed deadline for submitting a draft budget to move.

Each federal authority determines its programmes, plans and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) according to the strategic plan approved by the Cabinet within the budget cap. All authorities must also submit their initial forecasts for revenue and expenses allocated to chapters, line items, programmes and activities agreed upon, along with performance measures and efficiency indicators according to the circular issued by the minister, which specifies submission deadline. The fiscal year is composed of 12 months, starting from 1st January and ending on 31st December of each year.
Steps for participatory budgeting
The Federal Budget goes through 7 steps as stated below to be finally approved. In step 5, Federal National Council (the parliamentary body of the UAE) receives the draft budget for discussion. Competent committee in Federal National Council discusses the budget of each sector and provides their feedback to the Supreme Council for approval.

Budget cycle
The federal budget follows a medium-term budget cycle. The budget cycle must match the strategy cycle of the federal budget. A budget is drawn up for each year within the fiscal period, before the start of the period, and is updated annually within the budget cycle. This principle ensures that the long-term government strategy is reflected in the budget on a consistent basis. The federal budget cycle was developed from a three-year to a five-year budget cycle.
