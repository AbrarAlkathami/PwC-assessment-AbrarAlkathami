Stability of the labour market in the private sector
The UAE Government lifted restrictions imposed on establishments that violated the law relating to work permits. This enabled them to get new internal work permits and renew existing work permits, and issue new internal work permits for professions of the third skill level. It also launched a national-level programme to support the stability of the labour market in the private sector to ensure the continuity of the performance of businesses in light of the outbreak of COVID-19. 
Note: The above was implemented during the early phase of the pandemic (in 2020) and was slowly phased out as the situation returned to normalcy.
