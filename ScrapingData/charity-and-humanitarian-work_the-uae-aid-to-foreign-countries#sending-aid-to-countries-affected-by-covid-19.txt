The UAE's policy on foreign aid
The UAE's aid has only humanitarian objectives. It is neither governed by politics nor is not limited by geography, race, colour or religion of the beneficiary. This is a practical application of the principle of tolerance and co-existence in the UAE. This policy was laid down by the founder President of the UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who stressed that foreign aid and assistance is one of the basic pillars of UAE foreign policy.
tolerance and co-existence in the UAE
When formulating its approach to providing foreign aid, the UAE has adopted the idea of sustainable development and improving the welfare of all mankind.
In order to consolidate the impact of its foreign aid, the UAE Cabinet has formed the 'UAE Humanitarian Committee', which aims to channel and combine the collective expertise of UAE humanitarian responders in order to facilitate, oversee and coordinate the country's humanitarian aid.
