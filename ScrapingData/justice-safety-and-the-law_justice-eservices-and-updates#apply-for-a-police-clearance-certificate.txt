Apply for a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)
A Police Clearance Certificate (PCC), known also as ‘Good Conduct Certificate’ is a proof of lack of the person’s criminal record. In the UAE, the certificate is issued by police departments across the UAE and it indicates that the person is not accused or does not have any criminal precedents.

The PCC is available for applicants who are currently residing in the UAE, or those who are no longer UAE residents.

You can apply for the certificate online through the website of Ministry of Interior and/or their smartphone app MOI UAE available on iTunes and Google Play. You can also visit one of the MOI’s services centres and get the document done after filling the application form and paying applicable fees through the electronic payment cards.
