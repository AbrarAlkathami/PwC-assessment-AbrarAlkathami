What is quarantine?
Quarantine is a precautionary measure taken to stop the spread of a contagious disease. It involves restricting the movement of healthy people who may have been exposed to a communicable disease. People would be confined to a house or a hotel and be away from others for a certain period of time, usually 14 days in the case of COVID-19, in order to ensure that they are free of the disease.
