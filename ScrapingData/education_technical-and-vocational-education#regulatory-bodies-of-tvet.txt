General information
The UAE needs to produce 10 Emiratis with vocational skills for every university graduate produced to achieve a sustainable and diversified knowledge-based economy. Therefore, it focuses on building a national system to ensure quality technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system. The government prioritises building relevant skills to coincide with new and emerging technologies, materials and systems, ensuring equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education materials and systems. It aims further to substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.

Joining TVET education
Vocational and technical education is a great platform for Emirati students who aspire  to build their vocational skills to have a flourishing career.
UAE nationals, who are interested in technical and vocational education and training, may switch to a technical secondary school at the intermediate level/Cycle 2 stage of education. Upon successfully completing the study, students will be awarded a Technical Secondary Diploma.
Accordingly, graduates from a Secondary Technical school (STS) who wish to continue their higher education, will have the same admission requirements as graduates from government secondary schools.
