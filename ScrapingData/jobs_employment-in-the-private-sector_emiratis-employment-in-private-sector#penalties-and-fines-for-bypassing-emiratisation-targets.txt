To support the commitment to achieve the above employment targets for nationals, non-compliant companies will have to pay an amount of AED 6,000 monthly, starting from January 2023, for every citizen who has not been employed. The amount will be paid through the digital systems of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), provided that the value of the monthly contributions increases by AED 1,000 annually until 2026. To monitor the implementation of these decisions in the labour market, MoHRE is working with the Cabinet Secretariat to measure the indicator of Emiratisation in the private sector.
