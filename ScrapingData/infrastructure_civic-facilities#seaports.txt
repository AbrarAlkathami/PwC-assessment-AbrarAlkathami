Zayed International Airport Expansion
Zayed International Airport Expansion
The 700,000-square metre terminal building is one of the key projects in Abu Dhabi and the UAE, to develop a world-class air transportation hub. The  Midfield Terminal Building (MTB) represents one of the largest investments by the UAE to deliver the needed infrastructure, in line with Abu Dhabi Plan 2030, that will cater to the growth of the aviation sector in the region and confirms Abu Dhabi's strong position in the global air transportation network.
The AED 10.8 billion MTB is expected to be completed in 2017. It is part of a wider ten-year (2009-2019), AED 37 to AED 40 billion airport expansion plan. It will initially handle 27 to 30 million passengers per year once operational and cater to Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways and the carriers it holds stakes in.
The MTB design focuses on passenger experience, highest quality and service standards, including the International Air Transport Association's 'A' level of service which is the highest levels of space allocation for passenger processing areas. The design targets to achieve 'Two Pearl Rating', in line with the 'Estidama' approach towards sustainable design.
