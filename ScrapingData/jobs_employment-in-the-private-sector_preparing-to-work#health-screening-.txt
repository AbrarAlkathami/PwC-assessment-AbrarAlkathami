Passport and visas
Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.
Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE. The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

Health screening
Foreigners planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.
