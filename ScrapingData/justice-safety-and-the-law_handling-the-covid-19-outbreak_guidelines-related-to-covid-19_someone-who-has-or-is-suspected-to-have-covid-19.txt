Instruction manual: how to deal with someone who may have been exposed to someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19

Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) has issued an instruction manual to federal authorities on ways of dealing with employees who may have had exposure to people who are either suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19.

As per the manual, all federal entities are urged to provide all possible logistic support for protecting their employees, customers and other people and coordinate with relevant authorities to transport people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from their work premises to hospitals for testing. Entities should also identify those who got exposed to people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 and isolate them at their temporary quarantine facilities pending hospitalisation.

In the meantime, federal employees have to adhere to all COVID-19 related precautionary and preventive measures, including reporting their travel to and return from abroad. They must also report if they came in contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 and submit their COVID-19 test result before reporting to their workplaces.
