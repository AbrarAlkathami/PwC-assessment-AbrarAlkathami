Enhancing the judicial system
The UAE Government made serious efforts to evolve its judicial system, realising its role in maintaining order and security in the country. Since 1971, the government has set up many courts and public prosecution in all emirates. It has enacted many legislations to accommodate the ever-changing socio-economic needs of the UAE. All the laws issued in the UAE are published in the Official Gazette (with their amendments).
In 2012, the number of personnel in the judiciary reached 287 members from 228 in 2008. By this time, Emiratisation increased by 72 per cent in this sector from 2008.
Further, the number of registered lawyers in Ministry of Justice reached 783 by March 2016 (764 are Emiratis and the rest are GCC nationals).
Providing access to laws
The UAE makes its laws accessible through its Official Gazette, where federal laws are published within two weeks of being signed by the President.

Raising children's legal knowledge
Raising children's legal knowledge
Juvenile offences make up a significant percentage of all cases examined by prosecutors in the UAE. Studies showed that juveniles tended to carry out crime because of a low level of awareness about the seriousness of such misdemeanours under the law. The offences were often committed on the spur of the moment. By teaching youth about the law at an early age, youngsters will be more likely to turn into responsible adults.
Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) had declared 2015 as 'child's legal knowledge year'. The initiative aimed at teaching youngsters about their legal responsibilities. The campaigns included short videos about wrong actions and their damaging results, like one who fights in school, uses the mobile phone to insult others or causes disturbance.
