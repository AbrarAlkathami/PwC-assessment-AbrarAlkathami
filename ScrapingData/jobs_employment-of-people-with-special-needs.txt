Federal Law No. 29 of 2006 Concerning the Rights of People with Special Needs
Dubai Government Law No. 2 of 2014.

The federal law stipulates that UAE nationals with special needs have the right to work and occupy public positions. Article 16 of the law provides: UAE nationals with special needs have the right to work and hold public office. Their special needs shall not be a barrier for their nomination and selection for a job. Special needs should be taken into account while testing the candidate's competency for the job.

Resolution No. 43 of 2018 in support of the people of determination aims to support the rights of people of determination (people with special needs or disabilities) in the field of employment by enabling access to opportunities in the labour market.
Resolution No. 43 of 2018 in support of the people of determination

The resolution requires government entities to protect the rights of people of determination and to ensure their right to work on an equal basis with others and not to be discriminated against.

The resolution stressed the need to provide working and health conditions for people of determination and not to terminate their services or refer them to retirement due to disability or its occurrence after appointment, unless retirement age is reached or a competent medical committee decision states they are not fit to work.
Further, it stipulates that the private sector should be encouraged to integrate people of determination into their institutions and grant them exemptions and privileges.

The law issued by Dubai Government protects the rights of citizens with special needs in the emirate of Dubai.

The UAE has also ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This way, the UAE strives to empower and promote the social inclusion of all.
