What is the Emirati Genome Programme?
The Emirati Genome Programme is a national project which aims  to use genomic data to improve the health of the Emirati population. The project involves scientific study and research aimed at profiling and determining the gene sequencing among UAE Nationals to aid in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.

The programme invites Emirati citizens to voluntarily take part in the study by visiting one of the sample collection sites and providing a single blood sample. The programme will then use advanced sequencing technology and artificial intelligence to generate and analyse a comprehensive genome data and produce a reference genome specific to UAE citizens.

Successful outcome of the programme will equip healthcare practitioners with quality information that will enable them to provide advanced diagnosis, treatment options and a personalised and preventive programmes tailored to an individual’s unique genetic makeup. It will also help to predict and prevent present and future genetic diseases better and implement new therapies for rare and chronic diseases.

Cloning
Cloning
The  world's first cloned camel  was created and born in Dubai in April 2009. The female calf, called Injaz (meaning achievement), was produced at the Camel Reproduction Centre (CRC).
world's first cloned camel
In November 2015,  Injaz gave birth to a female calf, proving that a cloned camel can be fertile and reproduce normally. The UAE has  banned human cloning  and research and experiments related to it  Read the provisions regarding human cloning in Federal Decree-Law No. 4 of 2016 concerning Medical Liability.
