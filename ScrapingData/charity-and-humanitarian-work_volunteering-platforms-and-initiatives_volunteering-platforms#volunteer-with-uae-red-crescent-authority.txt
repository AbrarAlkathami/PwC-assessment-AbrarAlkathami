The National volunteering platform- Volunteers.ae
Volunteers.ae is a portal to support volunteering. Volunteers can register themselves on this portal and let organisations find them through the portal’s online register. Volunteers could be individuals, a group or an organisation.
Volunteers.ae
The portal also publishes volunteering opportunities and criteria of volunteers needed; this will help volunteers to study the event and their capabilities before applying. Volunteers are entitled to recognition in terms of awards and volunteering hours which can be added to build their online profile.
The UAE has called upon all to come forward and register on the portal Volunteers.ae. This would be a timely and an appreciable thing to do to in view of 2017 being the Year of Giving and to continue the UAE’s selfless tradition of charity and humility. For details, contact 800-VOLAE (86523).
