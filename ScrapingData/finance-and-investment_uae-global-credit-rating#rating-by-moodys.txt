In August 2023, Fitch Ratings Inc., the US credit rating agency, rated the federal government of the UAE AA- with a Stable Outlook. The 'AA-' rating reflects the UAE's moderate consolidated public debt level, strong net external asset position and high GDP per capita. The rating is owing to Abu Dhabi's sovereign net foreign assets, which are among the highest of Fitch-rated sovereigns.
