Eligibility and value for social welfare
The UAE law stipulates that only nationals residing in UAE can avail the social assistance provided by Ministry of Community Development. However, it made some exceptions to this rule.
An Emirati woman who is married to a foreigner may seek a monthly assistance for herself and her children if her husband:
An Emirati woman can also seek social assistance for herself if her foreigner husband has no income for a reason behind his control, or if her husband's income is less than the average required to run a family.
An Emirati widow from her marriage to a foreigner and her children are also entitled for social assistance.
Further, a divorcee or a widow of an Emirati man can seek welfare for herself if she has children of that marriage and resides in the country and if she has no source of income or well-to-do provider.
The value of the social welfare
The value/amount of social assistance is decided by the UAE Cabinet and on the recommendation of the Minister of Community Development.
If the beneficiary has another source of income, the assistance amount will be reduced in proportion to that income, given that the assistance does not go below AED 625 per person.
For values of social assistance, refer to  Cabinet Decision No. 21 for 2005 and No. 14 for 2008  regarding amendments on social welfare values on the Ministry of Community Development website.
Special cases
People, whose applications were declined, may submit a petition to the Minister within 60 days of being informed of the decision.
The assistance amount may not to be given up or seized, unless it will be used to fulfil a court-ordered assistance for one of the beneficiary's family members.
In case the applicant provided false information or falsifying documents, the ministry has the right to stop the assistance and request for reimbursement of the amount given.
The committee has the right to pay the assistance to the legal guardian, if it is proved that the beneficiary is not qualified to handle the assistance for any reason.
The complete assistance amount is given to the beneficiary's family in case of his death.
Social welfare against disasters
Cabinet Decision No 22 for 2008 provides about monetary compensation to citizens for their losses because of personal or natural disasters which include fire and drowning besides other calamities specified by the supreme committee in coordination with other ministries.
The compensation amounts range from 50 to 80 per cent of the total estimate of losses in money and properties resulting from the disasters.
The ministry is also tasked with providing urgent aid such as food and shelter needed immediately after the disaster. Article 2 of the law provides that the ministry will provide within two days of notification about the disaster, an urgent cash relief of AED 300 per person affected per day.
