Marriage grant - encouraging Emiratis to marry Emiratis
The UAE Government aims to build and maintain a stable and consolidated Emirati family and to fortify the Emirati social and demographic structure, by encouraging Emirati men to marry Emirati women.

In this regard, the UAE established  Marriage Fund  under Federal Law No. 47 of 1992, complementing and integrating with the social policy set up by late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding President of the UAE.

In 2016, the entity Marriage Fund was dissolved and its scope was brought under Ministry of Community Development (MoCD). The role of Marriage Fund is with the Marriage Grant Department of MoCD.

The Marriage Grant Department in Ministry of Community Development receives marriage grant applications from UAE citizens and offers the grants to deserving Emiratis according to its set criteria.
