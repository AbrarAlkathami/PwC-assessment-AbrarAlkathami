Socio-economic empowerment
Empowerment of women in the UAE had started in 8 February 1973 when the first women's meeting in the UAE, 'The Renaissance of Abu Dhabi Women Association' was held. The foundation of similar associations began in other emirates. Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak envisioned the need to cope with the unitary ideology of her husband, the late Sheikh Zayed who was the Founding Father of the UAE and established General Women's Union in 1975 joining all women associations in the UAE.
Since then, the UAE has implemented a number of initiatives for the economic empowerment of women in the UAE. In December 2012, the Government issued a decision on the mandatory membership of Emirati women in the Boards of Directors of federal bodies, companies and institutions.
