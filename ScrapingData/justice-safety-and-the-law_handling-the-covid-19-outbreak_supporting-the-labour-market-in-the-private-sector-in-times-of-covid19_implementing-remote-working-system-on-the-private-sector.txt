Implementing remote working system on the private sector
The UAE Government implemented remote working system in the private sector to protect employees from getting exposed to COVID-19. It prepared a set of guidelines for the private sector to follow during this time. Guidelines included reducing the physical presence of staff to 30 per cent in offices and checking the temperature of the staff and looking out for visible symptoms of the novel coronavirus twice daily.
Note: The above was implemented during the early phase of pandemic (in 2020) and was slowly phased out as the situation returned to normalcy.
