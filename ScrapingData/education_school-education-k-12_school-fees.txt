School fees
Education is free for UAE citizens at government institutes up to the university level. Non-UAE nationals may attend government schools as fee-paying students.
The  educational councils and zones in each emirate  regulate fees in private schools, which will differ depending on school type, curriculum and facilities, and school ranking.
In Abu Dhabi, requests for fee increase from private school are submitted every January to the Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK). The conditions for determining the annual increase includes the evaluation agenda, improving facilities and infrastructure, investing in human resources amongst others. The admission of students of determination and provision of support needed for them is also taken into account while determining the fees. ADEK stressed that the fee increase applications must be linked to school improvement plan.
