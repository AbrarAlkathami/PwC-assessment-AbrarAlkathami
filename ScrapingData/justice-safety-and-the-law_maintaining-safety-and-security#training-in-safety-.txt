The Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual
The Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual
The  Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council issued the  Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual - (PDF, 43.5 MB) to develop safe, secure and sustainable communities by ensuring that safety and security aspects are included in the development proposals.
Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual -
The SSPM is based on the belief that places that are not within common vision or easy sight prove to be a favourable place for crime to occur. The primary focus for the manual is to reduce crimes against the person through changes to the built environment. It combines the three disciplines of personnel, information and physical security in a manner to create 'defence in depth', where multiple layers work together to deter, delay, detect and deny an attack.
The SSPM includes a set of strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potentially harmful effects on individuals and society, by intervening in the multiple influencing factors/causes.

Community Protection Face Recognition initiative
Community Protection Face Recognition initiative
To enhance the security of the UAE, Ministry of Interior deployed a  face recognition system  using advanced technology to protect the borders of the UAE, as well as its critical infrastructure and key assets. The system's biometric software scans images of individual faces for analysis and identification. It uses sensitive cameras to capture the faces of people. The cameras can scan and capture images of people standing near and far from the camera and whether in motion or standing still.
The UAE's smart initiatives to counter extremism and terrorism
The UAE's smart initiatives to counter extremism and terrorism
The UAE Government advocates fighting extremism by stopping suspicious funding, disrupting the recruitment of foreign fighters, securing borders, preventing the exploitation of the web and social media and by contesting the use of religious centres to promote hatred and violence.
To this end, the government established the  Sawab Center  to restrict violent extremist messaging on the internet. The word Sawab in Arabic means doing the right thing. This online initiative counters false claims, highlights key activities conducted by the global coalition against extremists and amplifies credible voices to speak out against terror.

The system receives a live feed from visual surveillance equipment installed on site and displays data in an integral system that provides warnings and enables quick access to events and incidents.
The system controls roads by monitoring traffic violations such as the use of hard shoulders, illegal parking and the misuse of roads and dealing with traffic accidents live.

The driverless vehicles will patrol different areas including tourist destinations of the city to boost security and hunt for unusual activity, all the while scanning crowds for known criminals and potential persons of interest to police. It can recognise people in any area and identify suspicious objects and can track suspects. Police officers can access the car through their fingerprint.

The new security system is so advanced that the mini-vehicle even comes with its own drone, which can be launched via a rear sleeve — both are monitored and linked to Dubai Police command room.
