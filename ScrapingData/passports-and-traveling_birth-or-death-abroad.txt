Registering a death abroad
In the unfortunate event of death abroad, UAE citizens and residents must obtain a death certificate and contact their embassy in that country for further procedures.
In the case of a death of a UAE national, the UAE embassy in the country where death occurred would attest the death certificate issued abroad and arrange for transporting the body to the UAE. If the death certificate is in a language other than Arabic, such certificate should be translated legally into Arabic and then be attested by the embassy.
When the deceased arrives in the UAE, the mortuary section will handle further procedures such as embalming, burial etc.
