An eSignature is used in electronic messages to identify the signatory (the sender of the message) and distinguish them from everyone else. An eSignature also proves that the message received is the same message that was sent by the signatory and that nothing has been added, deleted or amended. It may consist of letters, marks, symbols, numbers, sounds or images.
