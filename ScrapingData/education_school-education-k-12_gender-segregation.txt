Gender segregation

Government schools segregate male and female students at all levels except in kindergarten; although private institutions offer co-educational environment.
In 2018, Ministry of Education decided to apply mixed gender classes in public schools which allow the mixing of boys and girls in Grades 1 to 4. Â As of the academic year 2018-2019, mixed classes are applied for Grade 1 students only, and the new rule will be applied gradually in the coming years.
