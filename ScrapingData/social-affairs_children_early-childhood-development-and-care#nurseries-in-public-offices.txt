Many new mothers with government jobs are required to return to work when their children are as young as six weeks old, prompting many to resign or take long-term leave. In 2006, the UAE Cabinet addressed this issue by ordering all federal and local government departments with more than 50 women Emirati staff or where the women Emirati staff collectively have more than 20 children, to offer on-site nurseries.

Ministry of Community Development has two initiatives: Tawasul and Nemo for childcare. The Tawasul initiative aims at creating a means of communications with the children with autism and children who have problems communicating. Nemo, which is an upgraded version of Smart Growth for Early Childhood, aims at early detection of undernourished children under the age of five years. The benefits of the initiatives can be availed through the MOCD Connect  app available on iTunes and Android.
