Passengers travelling to the US need to undergo all processes relating to immigration, customs and agriculture inspections at Abu Dhabi International Airport before they leave the UAE. When the passengers reach the US airport, they will be treated as domestic passengers; they can save time connecting to other flights or on to their final destination.
In Dubai, this facility is available for passengers of certain nationalities flying with private jet operator DC Aviation Al Futtaim.
Please check with the airline you are travelling with for further details.
