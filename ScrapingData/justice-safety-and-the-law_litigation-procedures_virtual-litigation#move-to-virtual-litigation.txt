The remote litigation allows hearings to take place digitally, with judges able to hear cases live before delivering verdicts. The hi-tech initiative is in line with the UAE Government's stay-at-home strategy, aimed at limiting social interaction and helping to limit infection rates in the country. All parties involved in hearings - defendants and complainants and legal counsel - will be able to access a live video link.

In 2020 and 2021, most of the UAE’s courts suspended public court sessions and moved to operate services remotely. View remote hearing sessions via the below links:
