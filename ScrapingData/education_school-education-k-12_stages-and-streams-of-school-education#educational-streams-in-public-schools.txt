Once completing this level, the student will be granted a high school certificate, which indicates passing 12 years of compulsory education. Students who attended the technical secondary school will be awarded the technical secondary diploma upon completing this level.

All students will begin from Grade one in the general stream of learning. Depending on each student’s desire and performance, a student will be readmitted into a specific stream at a certain grade.

After finishing Grade 8, a student can choose to join the Professional stream (Vocational stream), where he will continue studying Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 and will obtain an applied high school certificate which is equivalent to technical high school certificate. The professional (vocational track) follows a practical curriculum for education. Learning is based on applying knowledge and developing students’ practical skills.

After finishing Grade 9 and depending on their performance, students can choose either to remain in the general stream or to join the advanced stream. In both, general and advanced streams students will continue Grades 10, 11 and 12.

The key difference between the general stream and the advanced stream is the range of scientific subjects. Students in the advanced track will receive more in-depth instruction in maths and sciences than those in the general track.

The elite stream is developed for academically outstanding students. The stream will admit students from Grade 6 until they finish Grade 12. Elite curriculum focuses on mathematics and science in a way that enhances the skills in analysis, reasoning and problem-solving.
