Framework of the National Biodiversity Strategy 2031
The framework of the National Biodiversity Strategy 2031 includes, protecting, monitoring and developing ecosystems and local species, conserving local genetic resources, promoting research and innovation, and enhancing awareness and building competencies.
The strategic objectives include rehabilitating and restoring 80 per cent of degraded land and marine areas, preserving at least 21 per cent of land and marine ecosystems, and improving the status of endangered native species by 10 per cent.
Waste to Zero
The global Initiative to decarbonise waste - ‘Waste to Zero’ - aims at accelerating decarbonisation and reducing emissions resulting from waste management activities. The first-of-its-kind initiative addresses the challenges of the waste management industry and its impact on the environment and climate.
Guideline on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)
The Guideline on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the UAE aims to accelerate the deployment of technology and innovation for sustainable aviation fuels. As per the Guideline, at least 1 per cent of the total fuel supplied at the UAE’s airports to the UAE’s airlines in 2031 will be sustainable and produced locally.
One of the main objectives of the guideline is to produce 700 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel yearly by 2030. It also aims to develop the national regulatory environment for sustainable aviation fuels and lead global cooperation in this field.
Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap
The Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap aims at reducing industrial carbon emissions by 2.9 gigatonnes cumulatively by 2050.

Focusing on manufacturing and hard-to-abate sectors, including cement, iron, steel and aluminium, the strategic initiative reflects the country’s commitment to climate action and achieving sustainability goals.

Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology built the roadmap alongside strategic partners in the government and private sectors. It was created in line with the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 by strategic initiative, as well as the UAE’s third update of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The roadmap comprises three phases as follows:
The roadmap comprises three phases as follows:
The first phase aims to reduce emissions by 5 per cent by 2030
The second phase targets a reduction of 63 per cent by 2040
In the third phase, emissions reduction is expected to reach 93 per cent by 2050.


In the roadmap, there are separate decarbonization timelines for different hard-to-abate sectors, such as iron, steel, aluminium, cement and petrochemicals. The roadmap indicates that carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and clean electricity and efficiency enhancements alone could be responsible for a carbon reduction of 70 per cent by 2050. The action plan set out in the roadmap will cut 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.

National Guide for Smart Construction
The National Guide for Smart Construction in the UAE is to be applied to all construction projects in the country, including buildings, roads, bridges, and tunnels. The guide aims to standardise building design through the adoption of smart building indicators and ensure the best models of smart construction and digital design.
