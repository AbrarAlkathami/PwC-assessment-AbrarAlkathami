What is Government Services Bus (GSB)?
The Government Services Bus (GSB) project is a part of the UAE mGovernment initiative. GSB helps federal and local entities to exchange data among them smoothly and provide their services in an integrated way. Such system helps the customers get government services without having them to move from one government entity to another.
Government Services Bus is a part of the FedNet initiative too. It backs the government’s effort to establish a comprehensive connection platform and approve the highest standards of cyber security and safety according to the directions of the UAE’s visionary leadership. GSB contributes to the improvement of customers’ experience and enables government entities to avail data from several sources. Consequently, government services are provided based on the most authenticated and updated sources.
The GSB project comes as a response to the directives of H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to connect services, increase quality of applications and raise customer satisfaction during the next stage of mTransformation.
The project provides easy, fast and simple way to get services and enhance the concept of mGovernment. It achieves governmental integration and contributes to the satisfaction and happiness of customers.

During the trial phase, federal entities implemented the GSB successfully. The project received interest and support of the federal and local government entities. The trial phase included a connection between GSB and Institutional Service Bus established by Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Center. Consequently, Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund could join the project in the trial phase.
The project contributes to the enhancement of government efficiency and service quality. During the commissioning phase, it provided 15 ancillary services to improve 10 main services provided by federal and local entities participating in the trial phase. Efficiency was reflected in saving 57,831 customer visits and 7,460 employee workdays per year (equal to the work of 30 employees per year). These numbers will be doubled after other government entities join the project and enlist their services.
8 government entities, including 6 federal entities and 2 local entities had joined GSB by April 2017. 11 services are completely connected to the GSB service.
