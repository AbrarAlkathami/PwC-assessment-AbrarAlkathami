Personalised and cohesive user experience
The UAE has introduced a Design Language System (DLS) and other guidelines, principles and policies for designing government portals and publishing content on them. The DLS ensures that users have a smooth experience while browsing. One of the key features of this portal is the ability for users to customise and personalise their experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. A personalised dashboard enables users to access, store, and review their data, interactions and transactions on the portal. Specific service transactions initiated through the portal can be saved and accessed later. Users can customise or personalise the portal to mark their favourite or most used online services.
