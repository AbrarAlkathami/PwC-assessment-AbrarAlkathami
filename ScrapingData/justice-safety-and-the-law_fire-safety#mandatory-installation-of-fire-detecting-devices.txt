Mandatory installation of fire detecting devices
Owners of residential houses are mandated to install fire detecting devices in their houses and subscribe to the civil defence eSystem as per a resolution approved by the UAE Cabinet in September 2020.
install fire detecting devices in their houses

The resolution will be applied to all existing residences and those to be built. Owners of existing houses have been granted three years from the issuance of the resolution to install the fire detecting devices.

It also stipulates that the federal or local government departments concerned with issuing licences for the construction of residential homes must ensure that fire detectors have been installed and the owner has subscribed to the eSystem, before granting a completion certificate.

The federal and local governments will bear the costs of installing these devices in the homes of people with limited income. The federal government had previously covered these costs for homeowners who receive social assistance from Ministry of Community Development.

Ministry of Interior, through Civil Defence Departments, will carry out the provisions of the resolution and cooperate with all parties concerned to facilitate its implementation.
