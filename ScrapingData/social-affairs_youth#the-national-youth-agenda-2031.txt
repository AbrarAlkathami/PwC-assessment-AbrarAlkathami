The UAE’s youth sector
The UAE Government sees young people as its greatest assets; the foundation of the country’s future. In 2016, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, committed to putting young people’s needs and desires at the fore, by creating the position of Minister of State for Youth Affairs – a dedicated post that showed the government’s confidence in young people’s capabilities.

This enabled the youth to shoulder national responsibilities, innovate and contribute to the welfare of the UAE's community. To achieve its vision,  the UAE needs the skills, energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the country's young people, and to do that, young people’s voices must be heard, their ideas taken on, and their recommendations implemented at all government levels.

The government took seriously the potential advantages of harnessing the ‘youth bulge’ in the UAE and in the region, appointing one of the youngest ministers in the world, nominated by universities from across the country. To place a young person at the helm of such an important government department was a vote of confidence in this generation’s ability to lead effectively.

Emirates Youth Opportunities is launched by Federal Youth Authority to help the UAE’s youth invest their time optimally under all circumstances and raise their competencies in future skills.
Interactive Youth Lab

From ages 15-35, youth transition through these critical stages:
Education
Work
Adopting a healthy and safe lifestyle
Starting a family
Exercising their citizenship.

FYA uses the metaphor of a plant to illustrate their strategy:
Character in young people is like the roots of a tree, it influences everything we do. Every action, attitude and belief we take is first rooted in our character. This means that the attitudes, beliefs and choices of our youth shape our nation and our world. Character matters the most.
Character
The UAE is on a mission to cultivate character in youth that builds on our core values of inclusion, tolerance, family and commitment to excellence.
The stem of the plant is the enabling environment. We provide both, a tangible and intangible environment in terms of physical spaces and enabling government policies for youth.
enabling environment
We believe that when we invest in youth, it is similar to watering the plants and providing them with sunlight and good soil. Youth will participate by sharing their talents and skills back into the country, which will build the foundation for the next 50 years of the UAE’s development.

Policies for youth
The UAE Government designed many policies to make the youth take part in every sector and at all levels of governance and decision-making, and to infuse them into the national strategy as key stakeholders and actors in the country’s development.
