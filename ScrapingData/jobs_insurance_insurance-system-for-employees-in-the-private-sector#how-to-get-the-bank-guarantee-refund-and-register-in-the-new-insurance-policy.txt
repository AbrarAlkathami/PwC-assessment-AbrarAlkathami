Insurance against defaulting employers
Instead of keeping a bank guarantee of AED 3,000 with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, employers can opt to buy insurance for workers. Called Taa-meen, the insurance will provide a maximum insurance coverage of AED 20,000 to every worker and protect them from the company’s bankruptcy or failure to get their legitimate dues. In case the insurance company pays the worker, the employer will have to repay the same to the insurance company.
