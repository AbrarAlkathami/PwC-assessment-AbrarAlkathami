The components of the system include: assignment of responsibilities and roles, identifying types of food alerts, identifying the criteria to report food incidents, including border rejection of food and adulterated products in the market. The system applies a classification matrix to the food incidents as either high, medium or low. It also includes the triggers for the classification, namely the severity of risk to public health, the size and scale of an incident and the number of people affected by it.
