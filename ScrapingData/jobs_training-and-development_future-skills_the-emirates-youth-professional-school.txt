In August 2019, the UAE Government launched the Emirates Youth Professional School (EYPS) which aims to provide learners aged between 15 and 35 with vocational skills and career development opportunities to prepare them for the labour market through continuous education. The school is based on a crowdsourcing model that utilises a mix of practical and theoretical learning offered for free by various teachers, institutions, experts and professionals. The school is an initiative of the Federal Youth Authority. It will open in November 2019 to bridge gaps between the conventional academic learning and the rapidly changing labour market.
