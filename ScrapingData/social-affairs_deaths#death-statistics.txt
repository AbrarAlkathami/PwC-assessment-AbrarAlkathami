Reporting a death
To report a death outside a hospital, immediately call the police on 999 (from anywhere in the UAE) and inform them about the incident. The police will fill out an initial death report and move the deceased to the government morgue.
call the police on 999
In case of death in a hospital, the authorities will fill out the initial death report and move the deceased to the government morgue. The authorities at the morgue will issue a death certificate declaration.
The death certificate declaration will need to be stamped by the police after which they will issue a no objection certificate (NOC). Separate NOCs might be needed for releasing the body, for embalming at the mortuary and if you wish to convey the deceased to his home country. You will get the official death certificate after producing this NOC.
Registering a death
After getting the official death certificate, register the death with the UAE's  Ministry of Health and Prevention, Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Naturalisation and Residency of the emirate of residence. Ministry of Health and Prevention will register the death, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will attest the death certificate and translation and the Department of Naturalisation and Residency will cancel the visa. The process for registering a death might vary from emirate to emirate and depending on the religion and the residential status of the deceased.
In the case of the death of an expatriate, contact the  embassy or consulate of his country in the UAE  and inform them about his death for further formalities. Deceased expatriates may be cremated or buried in the UAE or their bodies may be sent to their home countries, on showing the requisite documents.
embassy or consulate of his country in the UAE
If you wish the body of the deceased to be flown back to his home country, you will need the death certificate to be translated and duly attested. You will also need an NOC from the embassy or the consulate of the deceased. The diplomatic mission must cancel the passport and register the death in the home country.
