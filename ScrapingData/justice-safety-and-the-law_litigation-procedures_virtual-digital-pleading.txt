Previously, the process of appearing before a judge for litigation took place either in person or virtually, with sessions scheduled in advance. However, this approach demanded considerable time, effort and procedural requirements from the parties involved. With the introduction of the ‘Virtual digital pleading’, the pleading has changed into an instant conversation format between the parties involved. This conversation occurs directly, with their statements being recorded and documented in the digital pleading minutes and the digital case record.
