Bank notes
The first dirham notes, introduced in 1973, were in denominations of AED 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100. Three years later the AED 1,000 note was released. The first notes issued had both Arabic and English lettering, with various landmarks of the UAE printed on them. They were similar to those that are in circulation today.
