Abu Dhabi strategic traffic safety plan
Abu Dhabi strategic traffic safety plan
The Traffic and Patrols Directorate in Abu Dhabi has launched a road safety management plan,  which aims at decreasing  traffic accidents' fatalities to 3 per cent per 100,000 inhabitants by 2021. Measures to improve road safety encompass the framework frequently applied in accident prevention work, which contains four elements:

Road safety audit
Road safety audit
DoT of Abu Dhabi introduced a  road safety audit  to be completed for all new highway projects; this audit would cover the phases of design, construction and post-construction.

Central traffic control system 'SCOOT'
Central traffic control system 'SCOOT'
'SCOOT' is a central traffic control system installed with sensors counting the volume of vehicles at signals to improve traffic flow at main junctions. The sensors will detect the flow, the number of cars on each approach and the cruise speed or the average speed towards a traffic signal. This new adaptive traffic control system is used in both  Abu Dhabi  and  Dubai.

Haseb
Haseb
In 2008, Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) launched  a major safety campaign that will go for life under the slogan  Haseb  (take care in Arabic). The campaign highlights safety issues on roads, in transportation, at construction sites, at sea and other safety behaviours.
Based on accident statistics of 2007, the campaign recognises seven key causes of road accidents, which include excessive speeding, use of handheld mobile phones, fatigue, not keeping enough distances between vehicles, not wearing seatbelts, lack of lane discipline and jumping red signals.

UAE eCall
Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) in cooperation with Abu Dhabi and Dubai Police launched an eCall system for automatic call in the event of traffic accidents.
and Digital Government

In the event of a collision, the eCall system automatically establishes a two-way voice communication via the cellular network to the nearest emergency centre. The emergency centre will dispatch a medical team to the location of the accident as soon as possible.

This system will accelerate the accident response time by providing a sophisticated feature for rapid communication with the emergency teams, which allows automatic and voice information to be received and logged into the system simultaneously rather than printing commands in a conventional manner.
