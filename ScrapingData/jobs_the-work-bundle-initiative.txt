Work Bundle is a result of close cooperation between federal and local government entities to enable clients to complete their transactions in the fewest steps possible through digital platforms. The entities include Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security, General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs in Dubai and Dubai Health. The project is supported by Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism.
