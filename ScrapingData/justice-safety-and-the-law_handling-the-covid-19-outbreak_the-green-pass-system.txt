There are six categories of ‘green’ status on the Al Hosn app, depending on the completion of your vaccination and validity of your RT-PCR test result. The six categories are:


Green for 30 days – Individuals who are vaccinated having received their second dose at least 28 days earlier or are volunteers in vaccine trials, for them the Al Hosn app will appear green for 30 days from the last RT-PCR test they did, provided the test result was negative. Additionally, the active icons of letter E and a gold star will be displayed for seven days.
So, to maintain a green status, such individuals must do an RT-PCR test every 30 days and the result should be negative each time. As per the latest update, the duration is reduced to 14 days.
