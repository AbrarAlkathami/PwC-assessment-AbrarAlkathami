Achievements of MBRGI so far
In the area of combating poverty and disease:
In the area of combating poverty and disease:
The UAE observes that the prevalence of severe poverty in a number of countries and regions across the world is the result of several factors some of which are deeply rooted because of poor international response and the absence of a comprehensive vision to address the issue. The UAE has become a role model in this respect due to its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, which prioritise poverty eradication.
Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives not only provide aid but also combat the root causes of poverty and disease worldwide. Their programmes have assisted 40 million people in 99 countries by 2015.
With regard to eradicating poverty specifically, MBRGI and its affiliated bodies have given financial and practical support to more than 1.5 million households in 40 countries. They constructed the largest infrastructure and logistics system in the world on an area of 700,000 square feet to provide facilities and services for charitable and humanitarian institutions. Between 2011 and 2014, the UAE donated 8.9billion AED to eradicate poverty worldwide.
In the fight against the spread of disease, their programmes have prevented and treated blindness for 23 million people and provided 81 million vaccines and medications in the past eight years. They have protected 3.6 million children in vulnerable countries from intestinal worms, which threaten their health and future. They have also built 46 hospitals.
According to the UAEInteract website, between 1971 and 2014, the UAE spent 2billion AED on projects associated with children's health, education and relief efforts in Asia and Africa. Some of these programmes involved vaccinating children against polio and measles with a special focus on Pakistani and Afghanistani children.
