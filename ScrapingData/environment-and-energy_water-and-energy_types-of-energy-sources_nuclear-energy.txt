The UAE government envisions to use nuclear power as the main source for generating non-hydrocarbon based electricity. It signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2009 and it is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR) is the regulatory body for the nuclear sector in the UAE.

UAE Policy on nuclear energy
The UAE government envisions to use nuclear power as the main source for generating non-hydrocarbon based electricity. The UAE instituted a comprehensive civil nuclear energy programme under the direct supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In 2008, the UAE published its policy on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The policy is built on the most exacting standards of safety, transparency and security, making the UAE, a role model for nuclear energy development worldwide.
policy on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
To meet the ambitious milestones set by the UAE's nuclear energy policy, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) was established in 2009.
Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation
Since 2012, the UAE has reached agreements with at least three countries (Argentina, Japan and Russia) on cooperation in the nuclear power sector. In addition, the UAE signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2009 and it is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant
The UAE is currently building four units at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, and the project’s overall completion rate as of June 2022 is more than 97 per cent. The construction of the plant commenced in July 2012.
The UAE is currently building four units at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, and the project’s overall completion rate as of June 2022 is more than 97 per cent. The construction of the plant commenced in July 2012.
The Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant is located in Al Dhafra of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, approximately 53 km west-southwest of the city of Ruwais. When all four units of the plant start operating commercially, the plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the country's electricity requirements. It will also prevent the release of 21 million tonnes of carbon emissions every year; this is equivalent to the removal of 3.2 million cars from the UAE’s roads annually.
