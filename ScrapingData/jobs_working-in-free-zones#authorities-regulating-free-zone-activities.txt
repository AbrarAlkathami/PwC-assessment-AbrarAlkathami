Those working in free zones are generally not governed by the UAE Labour Law. Each free zone authority has its own employment law and employees are subject to the rules and regulations of their respective free zone authority.

Employees are under a contract with the respective free zone authority. The provisions set out in the employment contract must be in accordance with the Labour Law.

Moreover, free zone employees are sponsored by the respective free zone authority and not by their employer.
