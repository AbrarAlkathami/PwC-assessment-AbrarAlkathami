Switching schools
This page provides information on how students can switch schools.
No test is required to switch from one school to another within the UAE as per the MoE's regulations. However, independent criteria for each school may apply.
Article 16 of Ministerial Decree No. 820 of 2014 on Registration Terms for Student provides for rules on transferring between schools.
