Gender equality in the workplace
The Labour Law provides that the female worker shall be granted the same wage as the man, if she was performing the same work. The Law on Equal Wages and Salaries for Men and Women ensures that women’s rights are protected, and they have equal job opportunities. In addition, the Gender Balance Council recommends integrating gender into policies and programmes, and implementing gender balance in leadership positions to bring gender balance at workplace.

Law on equal wages for women and men
In 2018, the UAE Cabinet approved a law on equal wages and salaries for women and men. The law is in line with the government's objective to ensure the protection of women's rights and support their role in the process of national development.

It is also a part of the strategy for the initiative of empowerment of Emirati Women launched by Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Nahyan, the President of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood and Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation.


Article 4 of the UAE labour law already provides that the female worker shall be granted a wage equal to that as the man is earning if she were performing the same work. This way, the UAE strives to empower and promote the social inclusion of all.
